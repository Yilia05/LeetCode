/**描述
There are N jobs to be finished. It takes a robot 1 hour to finish one job.

At the beginning you have only one robot. Luckily a robot may build more robots identical to itself. It takes a robot Q hours to build another robot.  

So what is the minimum number of hours to finish N jobs?

Note two or more robots working on the same job or building the same robot won't accelerate the progress.

输入
The first line contains 2 integers, N and Q.  

For 70% of the data, 1 <= N <= 1000000  

For 100% of the data, 1 <= N <= 1000000000000, 1 <= Q <= 1000

输出
The minimum number of hours.
