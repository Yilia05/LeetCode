/**
 * Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
 * 
 * Example:
 * For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2]

 * An easy recurrence for this problem is res[i] = res[i / 2] + i % 2
